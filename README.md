# contract.watch
**contract.watch** is an in-development _continuous monitoring_ tool for the open source contracts submitted to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). It facilitates the tracking of the `verified source contracts` beyond the latest 500 that are made available and also functions as a pipeline to run modularized scripts on them. Those contracts _(and the output generated by the modules)_ are accessible through a REST API.

> ###### **Important:** An Etherscan account is required to generate the <u>**API Key Token**</u>, Etherscan [offers](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) a free plan with 5 calls per second; when initializing a consumer a timeout can be configured with the `--timeout` flag in order to prevent being rate-limited.

### **Current modules:**
> - **solhint:** fetches the source code of each newly tracked contract and runs it through solhint (a solidity linter), with security rules applied to it.
